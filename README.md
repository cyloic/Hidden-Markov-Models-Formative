Human Activity Recognition with Hidden Markov Models
Project Overview
This project implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to recognize human activities from smartphone sensor data. The system processes accelerometer and gyroscope readings to classify four distinct activities: standing, walking, jumping, and still (no movement).

Data Requirements

Total samples: ~50 sessions across all activities combined
Minimum per activity: 1 minute 30 seconds
Sampling rate: 100 Hz (harmonized across devices)
Sensors: Accelerometer (x, y, z) and Gyroscope (x, y, z)
File format: CSV with columns: seconds_elapsed, ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz

Collection Tools

Sensor Logger (iOS/Android)
Physics Toolbox Accelerometer (Android)
Any motion data logging app with similar capabilities

Feature Extraction
Windowing Parameters

Window size: 1.0 second
Step size: 0.5 seconds (50% overlap)
Sampling frequency: 100 Hz

Time-Domain Features
For each axis (ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz):

Mean
Standard deviation
Variance
Root Mean Square (RMS)
Peak-to-peak amplitude

Additional features:

Signal Magnitude Area (SMA) for accelerometer
Correlation coefficients between accelerometer axes

Frequency-Domain Features
For each axis:

Dominant frequency (via FFT)
Spectral energy

Feature Normalization
All features are Z-score normalized across the dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction

PCA applied to reduce features to 10 principal components
Helps manage computational complexity while preserving variance

Hidden States: 4 states corresponding to [jump, walking, stand, still]
Observations: 10-dimensional feature vectors (after PCA)
Emission Model: Gaussian distributions with full covariance matrices
Training Algorithm: Baum-Welch (EM algorithm)
Decoding Algorithm: Viterbi (custom implementation)

Model Parameters

Number of states: 4
Covariance type: Full
Training iterations: 200
Random state: 42 (for reproducibility)

Model Performance Insights
Expected Results

Still: Typically highest accuracy (easiest to detect)
Jump: High sensitivity due to distinct motion signature
Stand: Good specificity but may confuse with still
Walking: May show confusion with standing in transition periods

Common Issues

Walking misclassified as standing: Occurs during slow or transitional movements
State mapping ambiguity: HMM states are arbitrary; mapping uses majority voting
Transition probability: Reflects realistic activity sequences

Improvements and Extensions
Potential Enhancements

More data: Collect additional samples for better generalization
Additional features:

Frequency band energy ratios
Entropy measures
Cross-axis correlations


Model variations:

Different covariance structures (diagonal, spherical)
More hidden states for sub-activity detection


Additional sensors: Magnetometer, GPS, barometer
Semi-supervised learning: Use unlabeled data
Deep learning comparison: LSTM/GRU networks

Limitations

Phone placement: Model assumes consistent phone position
Individual variation: May need calibration for different users
Environmental factors: Not considered in current implementation
Transition detection: Abrupt changes may cause brief misclassification
Computational cost: Full covariance matrices increase complexity
